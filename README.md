This is an example of an Edge/Chrome extension that will get the page source, find a JSON in a tag and display elements of it in a new window.
You can limit the extension to the target site through the browser settings for it.
If a tag is missing you can skip the display of the JSON.

Here is how to load an unpacked extension for debug and test:<br>

Hope you find some use in this example.
